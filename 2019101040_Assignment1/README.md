Assumptions making in Question1:

I am printing output file already exists after that I will overwrite the existing file and that if reversed file already exists and .if not then not.and if the output file is there and the permissions are not there then permission denied and out put already exists.

Assumptions making in Question2:

If the Assignment directory is already there the it says yes. So please ensure that the Assignment is not there in that folder.And if the Assignment folder has no permission then the file in that also is permission denied And if the files have readonly permission its ok. If one of the file is missing or not then the reversing does not happen so the line does not print. If the old or new file is directory then also the reversed thing will not happen and the permissions will not displayed as these are not files.

these are the assumptions I made.

I prefered write() more than perror.
